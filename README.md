# TODO Rails App (Backend part)

This repo sends the data to the frontend app. You can go to the frontend repo [here](https://github.com/germanruzca/todo_app_fr)

This repo is to practice:
- Ruby
- Ruby On Rails
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL
- JWT
- TDD

Also, this is the backend side of the project, I will try to build an ReactJS Frontend App.
